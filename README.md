This is a Monopoly Game based on the districts of San Francisco. But since a regular Monopoly game is time intensive. In this Monopoly game, each player rolls a dice once. And depending on their position, the winner is chosen. If no body lands on any body else's property, then there are no winners. Then the player with the most amount of money in his/her bank balance wins.

This application is written as a backend in node.js

The data for the property and player is stored in MYSQL database.

The user is prompted using the inquirer npm package.

The node npm packages used are mysql and inquirer.
